description: For the class “Communication, Culture and Society” the students had
  to create a visual product relating to that year’s theme, which was “the
  Culture of Consumption”. My team chose to present it in the form of a fashion
  magazine. We had to learn how to take professional-looking photos and build a
  magazine print layout. A really fun exercise that exceeded our expectations!
