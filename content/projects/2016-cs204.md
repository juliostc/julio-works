  For the class “Communication, Culture and Society” the students had to create
  a visual product relating to that year’s theme, which was “the Culture of
  Consumption”. My team chose to present it in the form of a fashion magazine.
  We had to learn how to take professional-looking photos and build a magazine
  print layout. A really fun exercise that exceeded our expectations!
